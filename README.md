X-Project 

WeRateDogs is a [X] Twitter account that  posts and rates dog pictures. 
This project dives deep into the data behind WeRateDogs, focusing on wrangling and analysing the Twitter archive over a specified period.
Most of the essential data was provided by Udacity; 
it includes detailed information about each post, such as the dog's name, rating, and type (doggo, floofer, pupper, or puppo). 
Additionally, some data was gathered using the Twitter API.
Udacity also processed the images from the WeRateDogs account through a neural network, generating three predictions for each image.
Each prediction includes confidence data and whether the prediction corresponds to a specific dog breed.
In this data wrangling work, I focused exclusively on original tweets by WeRateDogs that include ratings and images. 

I analysed the cleaned data to answer several questions:
1.	Which dog breeds are the most popular based on the number of posts, user interactions (favorites and retweets), and ratings?
2.	What is the correlation between favorite counts and retweet counts?
3.	What trends can be observed in dog ratings over time?
4.	What are the monthly patterns or trends in the number of tweets?
5.	Which dog types are the most popular in the dataset?

For this project, I used the following ‘toolkit’:
•	Python
•	Jupyter Notebook
•	Pandas
•	Numpy
•	Matplotlib
•	Seaborn
•	Statsmodels
•	API
•	Requests
•	Tweepy
•	JSON
